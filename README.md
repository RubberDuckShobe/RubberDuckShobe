### Hi!

I'm Rubber Duck Shobe/m1nt_/the_crescent_moon.
Feel free to check my [website](https://rubberduckshobe.github.io) for a bit more info.

I made [audiosurf-rpc](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch/audiosurf-rpc) and created the [AudiosurfResearch](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch) org as a hub of everything about Audiosurf's internals (tools, documentation, etc.)

My most notable project is [Wavebreaker](https://wavebreaker.arcadian.garden), an open-source reimplementation of Audiosurf's game server, complete with a backend and frontend.
